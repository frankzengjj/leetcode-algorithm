# Alogrithm Questions Log

This repo contains all my answers for leetcode questions, and I use it as a means to movtivate me and keep my mind sharp.

## Previous Log

In 2019, I graduated from University of Wisconsin - Madison in Computer Science and Statistics. To find a software engineer job, I started coding leetcode. Now I am a software engineer at Hive AI.

## Current Log

I started doing leetcode again but this time I start with coderpro (which are a bunch of leetcode questions collected by third party).
